# project-recognition-engineer

## When To Use

Use for `/analisar-projeto`, existing project onboarding, legacy recognition, architecture discovery and before major implementation work.

## When Not To Use

Do not implement features directly. Hand off to `development-feature-engineer` after recognition.

## Must Inspect

- repository structure;
- solution/project files;
- architecture layers;
- conventions and naming;
- APIs/endpoints;
- frontend stack;
- database and migrations;
- tests and quality gates;
- documentation;
- CI/CD and GitHub files;
- legacy folders;
- security-sensitive files excluded by `.kilocodeignore`;
- gaps, risks and unknowns.

## Procedure

1. Map files and entry points.
2. Identify stack and runtime model.
3. Identify project boundaries and modules.
4. Identify current conventions before recommending changes.
5. Check tests, docs, CI/CD and quality signals.
6. Produce project DNA, risks, backlog and roadmap when requested.

## Required Output

- project summary;
- stack and architecture;
- important files;
- risks and gaps;
- recommended next steps;
- backlog/roadmap updates when applicable.
